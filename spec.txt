CRITICAL
DATA Structure Revisions Needed! Use CRS Reviews Custom Post type!
Reviews need to be stored as posts in the database with custom taxa and metas
Using these terms:

       /suite/admin/class-review-init.php to register custom post type
       /suite/damin/class-php-review-importer.php to get them into the database

       -- see BL_Init_Review_Post and main file, lines 228-290

       add_action( 'init', array( 'CRSReviewInit', 'review_custom_post_type' ) );
       add_action( 'init', array( 'CRSReviewInit', 'crs_review_star_tax' ) );
       add_action( 'init', array( 'CRSReviewInit', 'crs_review_star_numbers' ) );

       Need to add meta key values for author_avatar, listing_directory, locale_id,
         timestamp, and id in the database

      Currently they are stored as an array in options->'bl_api_client_activity'['reviews']

      The database commit action is currently at the bottom of BL_Scraper::call_local_dir()
      Aggregate reviews arrays should still commit to the options table for easy updates & access
      They are a fixed size and won't take up space

MANAGED?
Server execution timeout problem - summary;
  Default API Call is for the first 100 reviews; can pull up to 500 in one 'page' if
  set to 'all', but approaching 100 review range is where the server execution
  timeout limit seems to occur quite consistently.
  COMPLETED 6.15.2020:
  We can eliminate these occasions by limiting the size of the API call.
  Since the update tasks are time based, it makes sense to set a small lookback
  window of time and run the importer that often for that previous period.
  Updated 6.16.2020:
  That also means we need a way to get the old reviews into the database -
  The Serverless CLI tool Baby-Lambda exports JSON & CSV files per API call,
  runs pagination operations to get all the reviews, and is faster than WordPress.

=========================
  WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?
=========================
  Build the data backlog prior to plugin upload using baby-lambda csv export.
  Plugin activation writes the csv to the database.
  The API call tasks maintain database updates at periodic intervals.

  TO DO
  - add 'build' script to baby-lambda to iterate raw review properties and add
    needed meta-values of locale ID and directory (currently in filenames)
  - Roll baby-lambda into the plugin and point the main script at its dependencies
  - add custom NAP REST endpoint in the plugin so baby-lambda can call the site
    by key=>val pairs of client-name=>url on the CIS and get valid NAPs for its API calls.
  - point CSV upload routine at baby-lambda's exported CSV files to post the
     review backlogs using raw SQL operations in an expanded activtion hook
