CRITICAL
DATA Structure Revisions Needed! Use CRS Reviews Custom Post type
Reviews need to be stored as posts in the database with custom taxa and metas
Using these terms
       suite/admin/class-review-init.php to register custom post type
       suite/damin/class-php-review-importer.php

       add_action( 'init', array( 'CRSReviewInit', 'crs_review_star_tax' ) );
       add_action( 'init', array( 'CRSReviewInit', 'crs_review_star_numbers' ) );
       add_action( 'admin_init', array('CRSReviewInit', 'crs_review_meta') );

       need to add meta key values for author avatar, directory, locale id, post date


Server execution timeout problem - summary;
  Default API Call is for the first 100 reviews; can pull up to 500 in one 'page' if
  set to 'all', but approaching 100 review range is where the server execution
  timeout limit seems to occur quite consistently.
  Hopefully we can eliminate these occasions by limiting the size of the API call.
  Since the update tasks are time based, it makes sense to set a small lookback window
  of time and run the importer that often for that previous period.  That also means
  we need a way to get the old reviews into the database
