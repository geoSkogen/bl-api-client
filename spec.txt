DATA Structure Revisions Needed! Use CRS Reviews Custom Post type
Reviews need to be stored as posts in the database with custom taxa and metas
Using these terms
       /suite/admin/class-review-init.php to register custom post type
       /suite/damin/class-php-review-importer.php to get them into the database

       add_action( 'init', array( 'CRSReviewInit', 'review_custom_post_type' ) );
       add_action( 'init', array( 'CRSReviewInit', 'crs_review_star_tax' ) );
       add_action( 'init', array( 'CRSReviewInit', 'crs_review_star_numbers' ) );

       need to add meta key values for author avatar, directory, locale id, post date, id

Server execution timeout problem - summary;
  Default API Call is for the first 100 reviews; can pull up to 500 in one 'page' if
  set to 'all', but approaching 100 review range is where the server execution
  timeout limit seems to occur quite consistently.
  COMPLETED:
  We can eliminate these occasions by limiting the size of the API call.
  Since the update tasks are time based, it makes sense to set a small lookback
  window of time and run the importer that often for that previous period.
  ALSO COMPLETED:
  That also means we need a way to get the old reviews into the database -
  The Serverless CLI tool Baby-Lambda exports JSON & CSV files per API call,
  runs pagination operations to get all the reviews, and is faster than WordPress.
