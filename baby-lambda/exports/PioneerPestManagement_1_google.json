Thanks Pioneer, but no thanks. Your ant service SUCKS and as long as they are charging $150 for 5 minutes of work with 3 difficult full ant treatments and the ants are worse now than before!

Carl was able to take care of the nests quickly and thoroughly. He was informative and was truly here to help us with the problem and not just perform a service.  We recommend Pioneer Pest Management to anyone that is looking for professional and honest pest control service.   It was mentioned that it will take about 3 weeks for the service to be in full effect so I will update this in a month or so if things change, but I\u2019m almost certain it will not.","positive":[],"critical":[],"author_avatar":"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/-kdBc9GNRZuw\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/rkRG3mKFLNE\/s40-c-rp-mo-br100\/photo.jpg","id":"2d7b663196d880b6f26ba3d8cc53e4fa2972f578"},{"rating":5,"author":"Kristina Elseth","timestamp":"2019-06-18","text":"Pioneer had been recommended to me by a friend who had also uses them and was very happy with the results.
