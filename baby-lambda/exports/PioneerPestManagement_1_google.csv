He went above and beyond to both kill the wasps and to take care that they would never bother us again.  And the job was not easy - it was 15 feet up on a shop roof.  He used three kinds of mesh and sealed things up so nicely, and gave me pictures to show exactly what he did.  The price was right, a fantastic job was done, and Zack was a total pleasure to deal with.  I'll certainly be calling Zack in the future when I need help!","Array","Array","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_0ewE1j6Ov0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/uCsP8hgfFbc/s40-c-rp-mo-br100/photo.jpg","5bce08a83f33c2ac0babef05449a37262b0d034f"

A couple days later we had someone come out to our apartment because we've had swarms of ants all over our apartment. (They have been worse than last year.) So we finally decided store bought traps weren't enough to get rid of them. The employee they sent was friendly and explained everything he was doing. He discussed pricing with us and did great job. I haven't seen a single ant since they sprayed and put traps out. They said its takes about 20 days for the ants to take it back to their nest. So far I've seen no ants. Their service also comes with warranty. I'm so impressed.  Thank you.","Array","Array","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Bnn9z4aSi6E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/hQ8VwB6QcXk/s40-c-rp-mo-br100/photo.jpg","6b132a09f07c6e3d65b79c8e220a0d9491eca9c4"

"5","DK Foster","2019-11-18","When we found out we had rats in and around our house we were extremely concerned and called Pioneer. Tyler came out and inspected and went over his findings and what our options were. He was extremely knowledgeable and professional. I had concerns about using the bait boxes and he was very patient and helped me understand so that I was comfortable with our plan and it seems to have worked well. After the first few days we saw no more activity though we left the boxes for longer just to be sure. Tyler was equally as patient and professional on the follow up visits and if we ever have any problems in the future he would certainly be our first call. My husband and I wholeheartedly recommend Pioneer and Tyler.","Array","Array","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Wn105g4XgX8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/L1phOEoAjmI/s40-c-rp-mo-br100/photo.jpg","5bf0d3e82b56b00cd59a3b39f8180a96ec1b6660"

Thanks Pioneer, but no thanks. Your ant service SUCKS and as long as they are charging $150 for 5 minutes of work with 3 difficult full ant treatments and the ants are worse now than before!  Tim came to my home right on schedule, very nice and was clear about what issues I have and what needs to be done.  I appreciate the fact that he didn't suggest treatments for my home that weren't necessary.

"5","David Smith","2019-06-18","We have been using Pioneer pest for about 4 years. It all started after we had some trees take out along the house. The tree service noted that there were a lot on ants on one of the trees. I didn't think too much about it until the next morning when I went into the garage and found two walls covered with ants. Not knowing what to do I grabbed the shop vac and and started vacuuming up the ants. I got most of them and in the end we had about 2 1/2 gallons of ants. We had Pioneer come out the next day and they sprayed the garage and the complete perimeter of the house. We have pioneer spay twice and year spring and fall and we are ant free. They are easy to work with and very prompt. We would not use anyone else   Dave Smith","Array","Array","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QVGAJGEkz2Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/BW-zFSrkWKY/s40-c-rp-mo-br100/photo.jpg","c5499e010039ed9b2094dc8598051db37dbc57c5"

She scheduled a technician for the same day. Daniel (the tech) spent a full hour removing a very large nest (size of a beach ball) in our junipers.  Problem solved on the same day I called!  After discussing the racoon footprints in our crawl space, Daniel mentioned that they could install special screens (that are racoon proof) from the inside our crawl space to keep all large and small critters out.  We had Daniel come back and install the screens.  Now, we don't have to worry about critters getting in our crawl space.  Overall, we have been highly impressed with the quality of the work completed by Daniel and would definitely recommend Pioneer for any pest problems!","Array","Array","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1hX4LjKBURk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/OElOWfJafAc/s40-c-rp-mo-br100/photo.jpg","dc4d1832ec82d8d002157a99b75846b94f56b615"

A couple days later we had someone come out to our apartment because we've had swarms of ants all over our apartment. (They have been worse than last year.) So we finally decided store bought traps weren't enough to get rid of them. The employee they sent was friendly and explained everything he was doing. He discussed pricing with us and did great job. I haven't seen a single ant since they sprayed and put traps out. They said its takes about 20 days for the ants to take it back to their nest. So far I've seen no ants. Their service also comes with warranty. I'm so impressed.

Tyler came out and inspected and went over his findings and what our options were. He was extremely knowledgeable and professional. I had concerns about using the bait boxes and he was very patient and helped me understand so that I was comfortable with our plan and it seems to have worked well. After the first few days we saw no more activity though we left the boxes for longer just to be sure. Tyler was equally as patient and professional on the follow up visits and if we ever have any problems in the future he would certainly be our first call. My husband and I wholeheartedly recommend Pioneer and Tyler.","Array","Array","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Wn105g4XgX8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/L1phOEoAjmI/s40-c-rp-mo-br100/photo.jpg","5bf0d3e82b56b00cd59a3b39f8180a96ec1b6660"

Thanks Pioneer, but no thanks. Your ant service SUCKS and as long as they are charging $150 for 5 minutes of work with 3 difficult full ant treatments and the ants are worse now than before!  Tim came to my home right on schedule, very nice and was clear about what issues I have and what needs to be done.  I appreciate the fact that he didn't suggest treatments for my home that weren't necessary.

The tree service noted that there were a lot on ants on one of the trees. I didn't think too much about it until the next morning when I went into the garage and found two walls covered with ants. Not knowing what to do I grabbed the shop vac and and started vacuuming up the ants. I got most of them and in the end we had about 2 1/2 gallons of ants. We had Pioneer come out the next day and they sprayed the garage and the complete perimeter of the house. We have pioneer spay twice and year spring and fall and we are ant free. They are easy to work with and very prompt.

She scheduled a technician for the same day. Daniel (the tech) spent a full hour removing a very large nest (size of a beach ball) in our junipers.  Problem solved on the same day I called!  After discussing the racoon footprints in our crawl space, Daniel mentioned that they could install special screens (that are racoon proof) from the inside our crawl space to keep all large and small critters out.  We had Daniel come back and install the screens.  Now, we don't have to worry about critters getting in our crawl space.  Overall, we have been highly impressed with the quality of the work completed by Daniel and would definitely recommend Pioneer for any pest problems!","Array","Array","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1hX4LjKBURk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/OElOWfJafAc/s40-c-rp-mo-br100/photo.jpg","dc4d1832ec82d8d002157a99b75846b94f56b615"

He is such a nice guy and very knowledgeable and professional. He arrived perfectly on time and with a smile on his face. He was courteous and friendly throughout the appointment and explained what he would be doing. I’m allergic to bees so I was very relieved to have someone take care of this for me. I’m looking forward to planting flowers and mowing the yard now. Thank you Pioneer and thank you Ryan! I appreciate your service.

Tyler came out and inspected and went over his findings and what our options were. He was extremely knowledgeable and professional.

After the first few days we saw no more activity though we left the boxes for longer just to be sure. Tyler was equally as patient and professional on the follow up visits and if we ever have any problems in the future he would certainly be our first call.

I can't  remember who I  talked with, she said, (again, I  thought)  next Thursday. Well, Thursday  comes around and I call Pioneer and wonderful Kay answered. I told her that I  was wondering  about what time they be at my place. She told me that I wasn't scheduled till May 2nd which would be another week. I said I was staying at a hotel for the last 3 nights because of the smell. Kay felt bad for me and said she'll  try to see what she could do. She calls back and says they can be there the next day. Ryan comes and does a wonderful job checking out  my place. He was very nice and professional. Sorry I rambled on  but I wanted to show how Pioneer went far and above than most businesses.

Thanks Pioneer, but no thanks. Your ant service SUCKS and as long as they are charging $150 for 5 minutes of work with 3 difficult full ant treatments and the ants are worse now than before!  Tim came to my home right on schedule, very nice and was clear about what issues I have and what needs to be done.  I appreciate the fact that he didn't suggest treatments for my home that weren't necessary.

The tree service noted that there were a lot on ants on one of the trees. I didn't think too much about it until the next morning when I went into the garage and found two walls covered with ants. Not knowing what to do I grabbed the shop vac and and started vacuuming up the ants. I got most of them and in the end we had about 2 1/2 gallons of ants. We had Pioneer come out the next day and they sprayed the garage and the complete perimeter of the house. We have pioneer spay twice and year spring and fall and we are ant free. They are easy to work with and very prompt.

After discussing the racoon footprints in our crawl space, Daniel mentioned that they could install special screens (that are racoon proof) from the inside our crawl space to keep all large and small critters out.

I called another company and they said they don’t do 2 story homes and recommended we call Pioneer Pest Management. I’m glad I did because the person who came out to treat the wasps, Carl, was very professional and honest. I appreciate that he wasn’t trying to sell me anything that wasn’t necessary and was completely honest when I asked him questions about the treatment and how I should go about it.   Carl was able to take care of the nests quickly and thoroughly. He was informative and was truly here to help us with the problem and not just perform a service.  We recommend Pioneer Pest Management to anyone that is looking for professional and honest pest control service.
