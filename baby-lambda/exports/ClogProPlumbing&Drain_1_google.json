I had just installed new concrete curbing around my flower beds. I had Just had my underground irrigation pipes replaced. After watching my neighbors get their line replaced, I thought it advisable to have mine checked, so I called Clog Pro to have mine scoped. I discover that my waste line is both broken, and restricted! As I gaze across the street to view the brown \"skunk Stripe\" and assorted rocks & debris in my neighbor's yard after completion, I think about the recent curbing and new sprinkler lines being destroyed. I requested estimates from several companies, including Clog Pro. The estimates were varied and uninspiring. After they viewed the video of the pipe they said \"we gotta tear up the street\", or \"no, we don't have to\"... \"you have to personally get a permit from the city\", or \"no you don't need a permit\", \"we have to break your curbing and sprinkler lines\", or \"well, we will TRY to save them\", YIKES! Clog pro came out and explained the process in great detail, and offered options based on what they may find underground. Yes, the city DOES require a permit, and they will get it for me. They will also arrange for the required locating service for gas lines etc, and all required inspections. The process will be seamless and painless, totally turn key for me. They assured me that they would not break my curbing, and if they had to remove sprinkler lines, they would be cut, and repaired, not ripped out and left. They assured me they would restore the yard to pre-dig condition, and all for a competitive price! Sounds to good to be true! Everyone knows how salespeople lie, right? But they HAD been VERY professional, from the time of the scoping right up to the estimate, so I agreed to their proposal. How did it turn out?? Just like they said it would!!! I can barely tell they were here! They even raked the grass they had flattened  in the process! Check out the pictures during, and after, see if you agree! Clog pro people, I couldn't be happier!

I am a Marine serving in North Carolina but I have a rental in Vancouver.   Most reviews I leave or letters I write regarding businesses are based on negative experiences.  This review is different.  I don\u2019t care if it is a law firm, mechanic shop, real estate firm or plumbing company, we all know that the main goal of a business is to make money; however, nothing earns my loyalty like evidence that the person I hire puts their customer\u2019s best interests over their own profit margins.  Terese at Clog Pro did this for me when she saved me over $5,000 this year.  This was a huge expense that did not fall under insurance and I had to pay for out of pocket.  I had already made payment to Clog Pro when I received a surprise phone call by Terese, telling me that I am having my money refunded due to Clog Pro negotiating with the city on my behalf.  The city fixed the problem free of charge.  Clog Pro could have charged me, completed the job, and made some money.  Instead, they looked out for me at their own expense.  That says so much!!! Some businesses make their money by price gouging one-time customers in volume.  Other businesses make their money by taking great care of their clients and building a business off of a well-earned reputation and attracting customers that are intelligent enough to seek out this value.  It is clear to me what kind of company Clog Pro is from this experience.  Hopefully I won\u2019t have any plumbing problems soon, but when I do, I will know who to call.  Thanks again Terese!","author_avatar":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GhnY57x8gi66pRg1_8c42-QxxwhMhOs5IJc6jO2qw=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp","id":"86f2a1ee636ba9038a63295d548ba13fa68c2078"},{"rating":5,"author":"Randy Ferguson","timestamp":"2016-08-27","text":"Louis Griffith provided my service, which was very professional, quick, and friendly.

We only have one other bathroom, and the toilet in that one isn't very strong, so we needed someone as quickly as possible.  We called Clog Pro and immediately liked their customer service.  We had previously called another company we worked with, but they were hedging on getting someone out to us that day, which would really have left us in the lurch.  After I called Clog Pro, I called the other company back and cancelled our order with them. I called Clog Pro at 11 am, and they had someone out to us between 3 and 5 that day.  Don showed up right at the earliest possible time.  He gave us up front charges for what he thought it would be (hoping we didn't have to remove the toilet, which we did not) and then snaked the huge wad of toilet paper until it finally broke through.  The toilet was unclogged within 10 minutes of his arrival.  He also suggested that part of the blockage could be mechanical issues inside the toilet so he checked inside the lid and found a worn part ready to be replaced that could be responsible for less powerful flushing, and he offered to fix it for an extra $7 dollars.  We took him up on the kind offer and since then, the toilet's working better than it has in years.  The entire repair took less than a half an hour and came out to less than we had anticipated.  We are grateful to Clog Pro and to Don (ask for him, he's cool) for responding so quickly and working through the problem in no time flat.  He was a pleasure to work with and I'd highly recommend him and this company for your plumbing issues.  They're fast, have great customer service, and Don is a great plumber.

After 10+ years in our house we have recently had a 3 or 4 few plumbing problems arise.  I always began by dialing down the list for local plumbers and ClogPro always seemed to be able to squeeze us in several days before any of the other companies.  Not only that, but they were able to find and fix problems very quickly compared to plumbers we have used in the past.  Within minutes of walking inot our house, ClogPro owner Marsh immediately diagnosed an unusual problem previous plumbers were completely unable to figure out.  He pinpointed the precise area of the problem and when he used a camera to take a look, sure enough, he found an old 20+ ft cable left in the pipe by some previous plumber or builder.  Now the system runs better than ever.    I won't be dialing for plumbers in the future... ClogPro will be my first call.  Great job!","author_avatar":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Ghrj1hcLTwCrMvD_m5ZK4xFnqBJYiPUn7sF_BtSOk0=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp","id":"2cd5cd5a296200d3cb9323c5aac12b1c536a5445"},{"rating":5,"author":"Matt Bepler","timestamp":"2015-08-27","text":"After being unable to reach a few other local plumbers, I called Clog Pro this morning with our semi-emergency.
