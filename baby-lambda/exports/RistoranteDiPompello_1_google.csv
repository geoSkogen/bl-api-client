It's a decent place to grab a bite and I have no real issues, but it's just middle of the road in most regards.  The service was very good and we ate outside on the sidewalk which for these times was nice.  I had the lobster scampi and it was pretty good, but nothing to rave about, but no complaints either.  I had a caesar salad which was a little below average, but fine.  They served bread and some tomato concoction to start with.  The bread was fair, not great.  So overall it was fine and a reasonable place to grab a bite to eat, but it won't be making any of my top eats lists at this point.  🙂","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjFGDCMuC9ML3-7ldQVuMcKu8Mxorg_p3uQpcCfz4I=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba5","255407015435062e9b94eb1a98b628b71c361d23"

"5","Max Simon","2019-12-27","My wife, daughter and myself had dinner here Saturday 12/21/19. We went here because of the high ratings the establishment had. Our experience was not so memorable.  We had made reservations but they were not needed as the restaurant was not busy. There were at least 6-8 employees in the establishment this evening and there were three tables occupied by guests. We were seated and given menus but our table was not acknowledged by any server for at least five minutes. There was only one server even though there were plenty of other staff working but they were not waiting tables for some reason? Our server finally took our order. I had a ceasar salad that came to the table warm. The romaine lettuce was actually "warn". I have never had a warm salad that should always be served cold. It was just the start of what was to come. The server did not know the size of the shrimp nor did the chef and they order the shrimp from there febdo. Another red flag. Our mozzarella sticks were cold, the entrees were served cold and not tasty at all. Overall, this was the worst dining experience we have ever had.  Do NOT fine here. They have no clue what they are doing.","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-a0YpiSELt9c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuckafff0AZFNdQ8Ufn0IObA_6yFNtw/s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg","23135b664a6b6798020782c68c968b8be6a0ff39"

The caramelized streak sandwich had three thin slices, and with a white sauce, and a few mushrooms, the salad had four croutons and lettuce, limp and dull. The mushroom and prawns were six tiny shrimp, and was tasteless and one still had it's tail with watery white sauce....apparently the watery white sauce is the stable of this order. Attempted to contact facility regarding the quality of the order and found them to be unhelpful. Extremely disappointed especially for the prices, and while there in-facility reviews appear outstanding, I am left to wonder if this is the service travelers endure for hotel delivery because we are just visiting the area and frequently not heard from again. However, bad food is bad food, and this is no exception. Reconsider delivery orders from this facility, as I will not make that mistake again.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eI_yvRa06qo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuckP-CRqT6nKBCw5BUW5csrgWnic3w/s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg","461aae36eee3d7081aeb5983ecc2b0f784cfaeb7"

"1","Juanita Pia","2019-10-27","on September 27th, 2019 we had our rehearsal dinner at your restaurant. I’d been in contact with your general manager & catering/ event coordinator Alexandrea via e-mail and on September 10th, 2019 via email I inquired to see if the private space was available and she informed me it was via email on September 14th, 2019 then we emailed once after that regarding menu options.   On the 27th up on our arrival my guest informed me that they were seated in the back of the restaurant and I asked to speak to someone in charge Alexandrea informed  me there was another party upstairs that had more guests. She was very rude in my opinion and out of line in the way she spoke to me. I informed her of our communications and she denied having knowledge (I have attached the part of our conversation where she did indeed confirm the space on September 14th).   On top of that the service was awful and slow. Also, due to the slow/ bad service my guest were not offered desserts and when I requested them to go it seem as if I was asking for something I’d hadn’t already paid for. If I’m paying for something I expect to get it and that’s not what happened. Several orders came out wrong to the point people were so tired of waiting they accepted whatever was put in front of them to avoid a longer wait. My husband (the groom) waited over 40min to be served actually his food was completely forgotten. A persons salad was taken before they finished as well and waters were not refilled.  It was hard to communicate and be social due the noise and tight space. Which is why I reserved a PRIVATE SPACE. I had my family from out of town here and the dinner was subsequently the only time I’d be able to enjoy a meal with them while they were here. My husband had to sit away from me due to the lack of space and seating","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GimqR_KovGUFjLJYoNlPw9uYlBP9uwmSvUBQkRZ9Q=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba4","dd5fef1e69c89027844ba2bfa86b7915c4ffc90c"

The decor is tired, chairs and tables are from a closed buffet place, picnic type table cloth, there was nothing welcoming as other places I’ve dined at. Nothing was really close to top notch, the drinks were mediocre at best and not worth a second round. As for the food...lackluster, zero Pop or pizazz, over done and under seasoned, the price did not equal the meal quality. I’m not one for tough reviews, I prefer a positive, favorable experience and review, I truly hope the owner, management takes the time to train kitchen staff on true Italian food preparation, also review your drinks and bartending skills.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjrpJeQ-dRcK1kkGZM3nJWZrv1gGvHd3GPlCt2N=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba3","0365b4657442e964fe133eb501002dcf8764d9e4"

"2","Will Wiley","2019-10-27","Roasted garlic chicken, penne basil pesto chicken, and Caesar salads were all so blandly seasoned that we both were compelled to salt everything heavily (for perspective, we never salt our plated food, & try to minimize our intake). My cream sauce had no richness to it; Even the roasted garlic lacked roasted garlic flavor- I'm not sure how that happens- it was under roasted, though. The pesto was pretty good after the salting.  Someone needs to taste test the dishes & adjust the recipes where needed. While pleasant, our server needed prompting even after 10 minutes waiting for drink refills, while the place was not very busy. I hope that they adjust, I'd like to see them succeed.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GipeW_yXUVgO3NGw-Z7qZ7hwijOa45V5IFl8sWuwLY=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp","45959f124a99815550b00e64c79937927ad5cf28"

Very comfortable, family establishment with simple decor.  We were warmly greeted even though no reservation.  Got a great table in back.  Complimentary brusheta was very good.  Ordered a bottle of their house Cabernet Sauvignon with dinner.  My wife ordered the stuffed halibut with risotto and steamed carrots & broccoli.  It came with soup or salad.  She got the Caesar salad.  I ordered the chicken in pesto cream sauce with butternut squash and zucchini with a Greek salad.  Both dishes and wine were excellent.  The service was good and she made several good recommendations.

"3","Jamie H. Panda Girl","2019-08-27","This was our first time coming to this restaurant.  I've added the menu to the pictures. But I also added our food pictures too. So please click on the pictures.  The bread and dip is delicious.  The salad barely had any salad dressing on it.  So they gave me a small bowl of dressing.  The Male server brought our appetizers me and my husband each got shrimp and mushroom and the Male server hesitated and switched plates he decided to hand my husbands plate to me and gave my plate to my husband like he was confused who was supposed to get what but what he was doing was one plate had 5 shrimp and the other plate had 9 shrimp lol lol so the server gave me the 9 shrimp instead of my husband which I thought was kinda funny. But honestly the kitchen should be making sure the plate has an even amount of shrimp going out on plates especially when there going to the same tables. It was very obvious. Also the dish said mushrooms and my husband had 1/4 of a mushroom on his plate.  I had the Lobster Ravioli to me it didn't taste like lobster but it did taste like seafood and it did taste good.  My husband had Chicken Parmesan he said it was good but he wouldn't say it was great.  The reason why we're scoring the restaurant a 3 is because of how extremely loud the is.  They have the dishes outside the kitchen area and the guy who does it is so loud that he doesn't care how much noise he is making. They also put the used dishes in the bucket at the entrance just inside the kitchen and that makes a lot of loud noises as it's open with no blockers to the dining area.  It was so loud in there we couldn't hear our waitress.  People were talking loud.  We thought Mo's was loud. This place is much louder.  In the future we will get food to go if we decide we want to try other food.  The parking is parell parking and you can not park in the back.  If you can handle really loud places then give this place a try.

The kids Loved seeing the train go through towards the end of our meal.  My mother got the veil Saltimbuco and I got the chicken parmesan. My food was good, hers was Absolutely amazing. The kids got pasta and vegetables which they enjoyed but was typical kids food.  Our waitress was very friendly and very patient with the kids. She brought books for them and then brought them little baskets of toys.  We had a very pleasant experience and we all plan on eating here next year when we are back in town for the 4th of July.","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hW7UtmIB_Yk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuckCGfnFn-hYfSM_bZFPni9h3Ghmsw/s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba4/photo.jpg","a26cee34d54b81df6a686b168f573e4d102f1cca"

The waitress said that the menu is misleading and the way she described  the lamb to be prepared is actually braised. She even went as far to try and tell me that pan-fried is not with oil.. umm yes it is, at least that’s how I was taught my by culinary teacher. The part that really irritates me is that they do nothing to correct the problem other than offer you more of their disappointing food. Not only was my meal gross, but the hazelnut crusted halibut and Tuscan chicken. I would not recommend because of the food and lack of customer satisfaction.

But Ristorante Di Pompello bent over backwards to satisfy our group despite minor misunderstandings. We had a wonderful time and the staff performed magnificently. Now what about the food? Absolutely perfect! I enjoyed Salmon cooked to perfection with a soup to die for. I've been there many times before enjoying their various pasta dishes and ravioli. There serve mixed drinks and a wide variety of wines. Trust me on this.... Its worth a drive from across town to the quaint main street of Troutdale.

It's a decent place to grab a bite and I have no real issues, but it's just middle of the road in most regards.  The service was very good and we ate outside on the sidewalk which for these times was nice.  I had the lobster scampi and it was pretty good, but nothing to rave about, but no complaints either.  I had a caesar salad which was a little below average, but fine.  They served bread and some tomato concoction to start with.  The bread was fair, not great.  So overall it was fine and a reasonable place to grab a bite to eat, but it won't be making any of my top eats lists at this point.  🙂","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjFGDCMuC9ML3-7ldQVuMcKu8Mxorg_p3uQpcCfz4I=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba5","255407015435062e9b94eb1a98b628b71c361d23"

"5","Max Simon","2019-12-27","My wife, daughter and myself had dinner here Saturday 12/21/19. We went here because of the high ratings the establishment had. Our experience was not so memorable.  We had made reservations but they were not needed as the restaurant was not busy. There were at least 6-8 employees in the establishment this evening and there were three tables occupied by guests. We were seated and given menus but our table was not acknowledged by any server for at least five minutes. There was only one server even though there were plenty of other staff working but they were not waiting tables for some reason? Our server finally took our order. I had a ceasar salad that came to the table warm. The romaine lettuce was actually "warn". I have never had a warm salad that should always be served cold. It was just the start of what was to come. The server did not know the size of the shrimp nor did the chef and they order the shrimp from there febdo. Another red flag. Our mozzarella sticks were cold, the entrees were served cold and not tasty at all. Overall, this was the worst dining experience we have ever had.  Do NOT fine here. They have no clue what they are doing.","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-a0YpiSELt9c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuckafff0AZFNdQ8Ufn0IObA_6yFNtw/s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg","23135b664a6b6798020782c68c968b8be6a0ff39"

The caramelized streak sandwich had three thin slices, and with a white sauce, and a few mushrooms, the salad had four croutons and lettuce, limp and dull. The mushroom and prawns were six tiny shrimp, and was tasteless and one still had it's tail with watery white sauce....apparently the watery white sauce is the stable of this order. Attempted to contact facility regarding the quality of the order and found them to be unhelpful. Extremely disappointed especially for the prices, and while there in-facility reviews appear outstanding, I am left to wonder if this is the service travelers endure for hotel delivery because we are just visiting the area and frequently not heard from again. However, bad food is bad food, and this is no exception. Reconsider delivery orders from this facility, as I will not make that mistake again.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eI_yvRa06qo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuckP-CRqT6nKBCw5BUW5csrgWnic3w/s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg","461aae36eee3d7081aeb5983ecc2b0f784cfaeb7"

"1","Juanita Pia","2019-10-27","on September 27th, 2019 we had our rehearsal dinner at your restaurant. I’d been in contact with your general manager & catering/ event coordinator Alexandrea via e-mail and on September 10th, 2019 via email I inquired to see if the private space was available and she informed me it was via email on September 14th, 2019 then we emailed once after that regarding menu options.   On the 27th up on our arrival my guest informed me that they were seated in the back of the restaurant and I asked to speak to someone in charge Alexandrea informed  me there was another party upstairs that had more guests. She was very rude in my opinion and out of line in the way she spoke to me. I informed her of our communications and she denied having knowledge (I have attached the part of our conversation where she did indeed confirm the space on September 14th).   On top of that the service was awful and slow. Also, due to the slow/ bad service my guest were not offered desserts and when I requested them to go it seem as if I was asking for something I’d hadn’t already paid for. If I’m paying for something I expect to get it and that’s not what happened. Several orders came out wrong to the point people were so tired of waiting they accepted whatever was put in front of them to avoid a longer wait. My husband (the groom) waited over 40min to be served actually his food was completely forgotten. A persons salad was taken before they finished as well and waters were not refilled.  It was hard to communicate and be social due the noise and tight space. Which is why I reserved a PRIVATE SPACE. I had my family from out of town here and the dinner was subsequently the only time I’d be able to enjoy a meal with them while they were here. My husband had to sit away from me due to the lack of space and seating","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GimqR_KovGUFjLJYoNlPw9uYlBP9uwmSvUBQkRZ9Q=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba4","dd5fef1e69c89027844ba2bfa86b7915c4ffc90c"

The decor is tired, chairs and tables are from a closed buffet place, picnic type table cloth, there was nothing welcoming as other places I’ve dined at. Nothing was really close to top notch, the drinks were mediocre at best and not worth a second round. As for the food...lackluster, zero Pop or pizazz, over done and under seasoned, the price did not equal the meal quality. I’m not one for tough reviews, I prefer a positive, favorable experience and review, I truly hope the owner, management takes the time to train kitchen staff on true Italian food preparation, also review your drinks and bartending skills.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjrpJeQ-dRcK1kkGZM3nJWZrv1gGvHd3GPlCt2N=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba3","0365b4657442e964fe133eb501002dcf8764d9e4"

"2","Will Wiley","2019-10-27","Roasted garlic chicken, penne basil pesto chicken, and Caesar salads were all so blandly seasoned that we both were compelled to salt everything heavily (for perspective, we never salt our plated food, & try to minimize our intake). My cream sauce had no richness to it; Even the roasted garlic lacked roasted garlic flavor- I'm not sure how that happens- it was under roasted, though. The pesto was pretty good after the salting.  Someone needs to taste test the dishes & adjust the recipes where needed. While pleasant, our server needed prompting even after 10 minutes waiting for drink refills, while the place was not very busy. I hope that they adjust, I'd like to see them succeed.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GipeW_yXUVgO3NGw-Z7qZ7hwijOa45V5IFl8sWuwLY=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp","45959f124a99815550b00e64c79937927ad5cf28"

Ordered a bottle of their house Cabernet Sauvignon with dinner.  My wife ordered the stuffed halibut with risotto and steamed carrots & broccoli.  It came with soup or salad.  She got the Caesar salad.  I ordered the chicken in pesto cream sauce with butternut squash and zucchini with a Greek salad.  Both dishes and wine were excellent.

Two of the upper rooms are small and could be too close for comfort for some people. For spouse and I we sat in a little room by ourselves which was quite a nice experience. The owner or chef or ? (I'm not sure who) personally showed us various art throughout the restaurant, a very nice display. The food was very good, we went for traditional Italian fare spaghetti meatballs and Bolognese over penne. Nice waitress we had whom I sure does 5000 steps a nite up and down the stairs. I will come back for sure!

"3","Jamie H. Panda Girl","2019-08-27","This was our first time coming to this restaurant.  I've added the menu to the pictures. But I also added our food pictures too. So please click on the pictures.  The bread and dip is delicious.  The salad barely had any salad dressing on it.  So they gave me a small bowl of dressing.  The Male server brought our appetizers me and my husband each got shrimp and mushroom and the Male server hesitated and switched plates he decided to hand my husbands plate to me and gave my plate to my husband like he was confused who was supposed to get what but what he was doing was one plate had 5 shrimp and the other plate had 9 shrimp lol lol so the server gave me the 9 shrimp instead of my husband which I thought was kinda funny. But honestly the kitchen should be making sure the plate has an even amount of shrimp going out on plates especially when there going to the same tables. It was very obvious. Also the dish said mushrooms and my husband had 1/4 of a mushroom on his plate.  I had the Lobster Ravioli to me it didn't taste like lobster but it did taste like seafood and it did taste good.  My husband had Chicken Parmesan he said it was good but he wouldn't say it was great.  The reason why we're scoring the restaurant a 3 is because of how extremely loud the is.  They have the dishes outside the kitchen area and the guy who does it is so loud that he doesn't care how much noise he is making. They also put the used dishes in the bucket at the entrance just inside the kitchen and that makes a lot of loud noises as it's open with no blockers to the dining area.  It was so loud in there we couldn't hear our waitress.  People were talking loud.  We thought Mo's was loud. This place is much louder.  In the future we will get food to go if we decide we want to try other food.  The parking is parell parking and you can not park in the back.  If you can handle really loud places then give this place a try.

The kids got pasta and vegetables which they enjoyed but was typical kids food.  Our waitress was very friendly and very patient with the kids.

The waitress said that the menu is misleading and the way she described  the lamb to be prepared is actually braised. She even went as far to try and tell me that pan-fried is not with oil.. umm yes it is, at least that’s how I was taught my by culinary teacher. The part that really irritates me is that they do nothing to correct the problem other than offer you more of their disappointing food. Not only was my meal gross, but the hazelnut crusted halibut and Tuscan chicken. I would not recommend because of the food and lack of customer satisfaction.

We recently reserved a large upstairs room a week in advance and there ended up being some confusion about details that were not clearly explained until all 40 of us showed up. But Ristorante Di Pompello bent over backwards to satisfy our group despite minor misunderstandings. We had a wonderful time and the staff performed magnificently. Now what about the food? Absolutely perfect! I enjoyed Salmon cooked to perfection with a soup to die for. I've been there many times before enjoying their various pasta dishes and ravioli. There serve mixed drinks and a wide variety of wines. Trust me on this.... Its worth a drive from across town to the quaint main street of Troutdale. It's just off I 84 and would make a great stopover before or after a day trip up the gorge.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg6oviZG5KJcwhfzCzqE2rsuCaAMMo_-kcJRJvkUg=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba3","596a586dcb81c0305ea9bb9d82d90cb36c2cd467"

"5","Max Simon","2019-12-27","My wife, daughter and myself had dinner here Saturday 12/21/19. We went here because of the high ratings the establishment had. Our experience was not so memorable.  We had made reservations but they were not needed as the restaurant was not busy. There were at least 6-8 employees in the establishment this evening and there were three tables occupied by guests. We were seated and given menus but our table was not acknowledged by any server for at least five minutes. There was only one server even though there were plenty of other staff working but they were not waiting tables for some reason? Our server finally took our order. I had a ceasar salad that came to the table warm. The romaine lettuce was actually "warn". I have never had a warm salad that should always be served cold. It was just the start of what was to come. The server did not know the size of the shrimp nor did the chef and they order the shrimp from there febdo. Another red flag. Our mozzarella sticks were cold, the entrees were served cold and not tasty at all. Overall, this was the worst dining experience we have ever had.  Do NOT fine here. They have no clue what they are doing.","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-a0YpiSELt9c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuckafff0AZFNdQ8Ufn0IObA_6yFNtw/s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg","23135b664a6b6798020782c68c968b8be6a0ff39"

The caramelized streak sandwich had three thin slices, and with a white sauce, and a few mushrooms, the salad had four croutons and lettuce, limp and dull. The mushroom and prawns were six tiny shrimp, and was tasteless and one still had it's tail with watery white sauce....apparently the watery white sauce is the stable of this order. Attempted to contact facility regarding the quality of the order and found them to be unhelpful. Extremely disappointed especially for the prices, and while there in-facility reviews appear outstanding, I am left to wonder if this is the service travelers endure for hotel delivery because we are just visiting the area and frequently not heard from again. However, bad food is bad food, and this is no exception. Reconsider delivery orders from this facility, as I will not make that mistake again.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eI_yvRa06qo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuckP-CRqT6nKBCw5BUW5csrgWnic3w/s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg","461aae36eee3d7081aeb5983ecc2b0f784cfaeb7"

"1","Juanita Pia","2019-10-27","on September 27th, 2019 we had our rehearsal dinner at your restaurant. I’d been in contact with your general manager & catering/ event coordinator Alexandrea via e-mail and on September 10th, 2019 via email I inquired to see if the private space was available and she informed me it was via email on September 14th, 2019 then we emailed once after that regarding menu options.   On the 27th up on our arrival my guest informed me that they were seated in the back of the restaurant and I asked to speak to someone in charge Alexandrea informed  me there was another party upstairs that had more guests. She was very rude in my opinion and out of line in the way she spoke to me. I informed her of our communications and she denied having knowledge (I have attached the part of our conversation where she did indeed confirm the space on September 14th).   On top of that the service was awful and slow. Also, due to the slow/ bad service my guest were not offered desserts and when I requested them to go it seem as if I was asking for something I’d hadn’t already paid for. If I’m paying for something I expect to get it and that’s not what happened. Several orders came out wrong to the point people were so tired of waiting they accepted whatever was put in front of them to avoid a longer wait. My husband (the groom) waited over 40min to be served actually his food was completely forgotten. A persons salad was taken before they finished as well and waters were not refilled.  It was hard to communicate and be social due the noise and tight space. Which is why I reserved a PRIVATE SPACE. I had my family from out of town here and the dinner was subsequently the only time I’d be able to enjoy a meal with them while they were here. My husband had to sit away from me due to the lack of space and seating","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GimqR_KovGUFjLJYoNlPw9uYlBP9uwmSvUBQkRZ9Q=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba4","dd5fef1e69c89027844ba2bfa86b7915c4ffc90c"

The decor is tired, chairs and tables are from a closed buffet place, picnic type table cloth, there was nothing welcoming as other places I’ve dined at. Nothing was really close to top notch, the drinks were mediocre at best and not worth a second round. As for the food...lackluster, zero Pop or pizazz, over done and under seasoned, the price did not equal the meal quality. I’m not one for tough reviews, I prefer a positive, favorable experience and review, I truly hope the owner, management takes the time to train kitchen staff on true Italian food preparation, also review your drinks and bartending skills.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjrpJeQ-dRcK1kkGZM3nJWZrv1gGvHd3GPlCt2N=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba3","0365b4657442e964fe133eb501002dcf8764d9e4"

My cream sauce had no richness to it; Even the roasted garlic lacked roasted garlic flavor- I'm not sure how that happens- it was under roasted, though. The pesto was pretty good after the salting.  Someone needs to taste test the dishes & adjust the recipes where needed.

She got the Caesar salad.  I ordered the chicken in pesto cream sauce with butternut squash and zucchini with a Greek salad.  Both dishes and wine were excellent.

(I'm not sure who) personally showed us various art throughout the restaurant, a very nice display. The food was very good, we went for traditional Italian fare spaghetti meatballs and Bolognese over penne. Nice waitress we had whom I sure does 5000 steps a nite up and down the stairs.

So please click on the pictures.  The bread and dip is delicious.  The salad barely had any salad dressing on it.  So they gave me a small bowl of dressing.  The Male server brought our appetizers me and my husband each got shrimp and mushroom and the Male server hesitated and switched plates he decided to hand my husbands plate to me and gave my plate to my husband like he was confused who was supposed to get what but what he was doing was one plate had 5 shrimp and the other plate had 9 shrimp lol lol so the server gave me the 9 shrimp instead of my husband which I thought was kinda funny. But honestly the kitchen should be making sure the plate has an even amount of shrimp going out on plates especially when there going to the same tables. It was very obvious. Also the dish said mushrooms and my husband had 1/4 of a mushroom on his plate.  I had the Lobster Ravioli to me it didn't taste like lobster but it did taste like seafood and it did taste good.  My husband had Chicken Parmesan he said it was good but he wouldn't say it was great.  The reason why we're scoring the restaurant a 3 is because of how extremely loud the is.  They have the dishes outside the kitchen area and the guy who does it is so loud that he doesn't care how much noise he is making. They also put the used dishes in the bucket at the entrance just inside the kitchen and that makes a lot of loud noises as it's open with no blockers to the dining area.  It was so loud in there we couldn't hear our waitress.  People were talking loud.  We thought Mo's was loud. This place is much louder.  In the future we will get food to go if we decide we want to try other food.  The parking is parell parking and you can not park in the back.  If you can handle really loud places then give this place a try.

The part that really irritates me is that they do nothing to correct the problem other than offer you more of their disappointing food.

"5","Bill Emett","2019-08-27","I almost deleted the fifth star but because of true professionalism they came though to earn that final star. We recently reserved a large upstairs room a week in advance and there ended up being some confusion about details that were not clearly explained until all 40 of us showed up. But Ristorante Di Pompello bent over backwards to satisfy our group despite minor misunderstandings. We had a wonderful time and the staff performed magnificently. Now what about the food? Absolutely perfect! I enjoyed Salmon cooked to perfection with a soup to die for. I've been there many times before enjoying their various pasta dishes and ravioli. There serve mixed drinks and a wide variety of wines. Trust me on this.... Its worth a drive from across town to the quaint main street of Troutdale. It's just off I 84 and would make a great stopover before or after a day trip up the gorge.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg6oviZG5KJcwhfzCzqE2rsuCaAMMo_-kcJRJvkUg=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba3","596a586dcb81c0305ea9bb9d82d90cb36c2cd467"

We were all very unhappy. The prices were reasonable and the portions were decent so it made for a good value that way but one does not go out for dinner for cheap price and lots of food. Sadly, it wasn't very  good Italian food. Instead, go to the Black Rabbit Which is less than a quarter of a mile away.","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-z_vYarQ9OZI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucl-k8DiUglIqaPLMj7OMwTLDfveQw/s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba5/photo.jpg","2b90fbae4147f8c045fc1453e130106d520ac0b4"

I  got a dinner salad and although I ordered the large size I was still hungry when I was done. I would certainly recommend this restaurant but next time I will get one of the pasta dishes.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgOUXy5AVdSY9ntgdd1x7DRKXPqX0giGF9mdUSY2g=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba4","d4199f1bd136cbbdf9e25e2e8f8e6fa9dc933e78"

Saul is 100% Italian, but he was raised in Mexico City, where his parents had an no Italian restaurant! The menu is large and varied with something for everyone. This restaurant is a must do! I promise you will not regret it! :)","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bY-TY6bGmX4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucmGhtZdtYlKUBmx7aQ1MhXkbEQF3A/s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba3/photo.jpg","4e28fe7875a2432d6529fe80537d6d8e1ce83fc3"
