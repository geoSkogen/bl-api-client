Billie and the others at the Vancouver Wa location have really helped me, as recently I was selling my home and needed a larger size unit than my current one to store my things. Well the sale fell through because of the recent issues affecting us all and as I didn\u2019t need the larger unit they took my payments and rolled them into my smaller one that I already had, not charging me for 2 units as some other storage places might have. So again Storage Works has treated me with a high degree of kindness and consideration, very professional and always eager to help. Give them a chance, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Thanks Storage Works.","author_avatar":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Ghc_MO715EsLTcjoybSNdJaquDzW-U1-1S-uRni=s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp","id":"320c48b8c5f04d7ca28555274cd785e8a6a4124e"},{"rating":5,"author":"Stephanie Ashmore","timestamp":"2020-05-14","text":"Storage works at Van Mall is great!

The reservation process was a breeze on their website. I reserved a unit for the next day and when that day came Kayla called to make sure it was not a mistake. When I drove to the site Kayla was very friendly and knows her business. She made the process easy and took the time to make sure the unit I reserved was actually what I was looking for. It is awesome working with them.","author_avatar":"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/-JqNS3vVyhQQ\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/AMZuucmKzayPi4L55Qvc-6KHXWG-eG-idg\/s40-c0x00000000-cc-rp\/photo.jpg","id":"226575380aec41c48a6e59f413b3ed59f281d189"},{"rating":5,"author":"Brad Lucas","timestamp":"2019-12-14","text":"This was by far the best storage facility we have ever been to! Awesome staff, clean grounds, fair prices and secure facility. If we ever needed to this is probably the only storage place I use again. Never will I go back to public storage.
